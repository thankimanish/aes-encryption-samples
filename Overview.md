## Introduction ##

The intent of this project is to help those who'd like to learn how to encrypt data using standard libraries on different platforms (Java, C#/.Net, PHP, ColdFusion). Of course, it should be always possible to decrypt data on any supported platform, regardless of platform on which the data is encrypted.

## Why AES? ##

The AES encryption algorithm is widely adopted by many organization (including US government).
